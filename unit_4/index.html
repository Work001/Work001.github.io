	<h1>Tracheostomy Study 2016</h1>
	

	<p id="p1">A tracheostomy allows people with breathing difficulties to breathe through a tube inserted in their neck via a surgical incision, which bypasses a blocked upper airway. The introduction of a tracheostomy tube means standard functions such as breathing, eating and talking are altered. <br>
<br>

	 Patients must learn to adapt to these changes and regain control over their health and well-being. Nurses provide practical lessons in post-tracheostomy self-care; however, there is a large disconnect in information management between the practical lessons that the patients receive and the materials they are given as patient hand-outs. <br>
	 <br>
	 To address this problem, this practice-led research project explored the design opportunities in improving a tracheostomy patients’ educational journey. It explored the relationship between visual communication and educational content within a user-centred framework. <br>
<br>
	Qualitative data from expert interviews were analysed to help create a cohesive interactive website for tracheostomy patients to learn from. This process helped generate a design prototype that was discussed during a workshop with tracheostomy patients. New insights developed from the workshop verified assumptions and provided a further understanding of participants’ personal experiences with a tracheostomy. These results supported the use of visual communication in the educational healthcare context to improve the experiences of tracheostomy patients.</p>
