		<h1><span>Tracheostomy Study 2016</span></h1>
		<p>Qualitative data from expert interviews was analysed to help create a cohesive interactive prototype for tracheostomy patients to learn from. This process helped generate a design prototype that was discussed during a workshop with tracheostomy patients. New insights developed from the workshop verified assumptions and provided a further understanding of participantsâ€™ personal experiences with a tracheostomy. These results supported the use of visual communication in the educational healthcare context to improve the experiences of tracheostomy patients.</p>

		<h1>What is a Tracheostomy</h1>
		<p>A  tracheostomy allows people with breathing difficulties to breathe through a tube inserted in their neck via a surgical incision, which bypasses a blocked upper airway. The introduction of a tracheostomy tube means standard functions such as breathing, eating and talking are altered. </p>

			<p>The opening has a tube inserted. through the neck and into the trachea (windpipe).</p>

	<h1>Why do people need one</h1>
	<img src="http://Work001.github.io/unit_4/images/Main1.jpg" width="90">
	<p>Tracheal stenosis is a narrowing of the windpipe (trachea) due to tissue growth that can occur after radiation therapy, prolonged use of a breathing tube, or other procedures.</p>

	<p>There are various reasons for oral surgery, however a common result of this may be the replacement of tongue tissue. This can cause air way obstruction or difficulty managing secretion.</p>
